                Welcome to the CookBook Chat Bot! This bot is here to assist you with recipe ideas, 
                answer general cooking questions, and help you modify recipes to suit your preferences. 
                Hereâ€™s how to make the most out of your experience with this bot:
            </div>
            
            #### Step-by-Step Instructions
            1. Starting the Conversation
                - Begin by sending a greeting message (e.g., "Hello," "Hi there!").
                - The bot will respond with its own greeting, introducing itself and preparing for the conversation.
            2. Provide Your List of Ingredients
                - After the initial greeting, the next message should be a list of ingredients you have on hand.
                - List each ingredient clearly, and avoid extra information for the best results. This allows the bot to suggest recipes that match your available ingredients.
            3. Request Recipes Based on Your Ingredients
                - Once the bot has your ingredients, ask it to provide a set of recipes that you can make. The bot is designed to give you options that vary in complexity, including:
                - One easy and fast recipe
                - One moderately challenging recipe
                - One vegan recipe (or a more complex option if a vegan recipe isn't possible with your ingredients)
            4. Request Modifications or Additional Recipes
                - After receiving recipes, you may ask the bot for modifications (e.g., "Can I make this gluten-free?" or "What if I don't have eggs?") or request more recipes if you want additional options.
            5. Discuss Recipe Adjustments and Tips
                - The bot can assist in adjusting recipes for dietary restrictions, ingredient swaps, and cooking methods. Use this function to discuss modifications or substitutions in detail.
                
            #### Important Usage Notes
                - Data Privacy: To protect your privacy, do not share personal or sensitive information with the bot. Keep your questions focused on recipes, cooking techniques, or ingredients only.
                - Development Notice: Please be aware that this chatbot is still in the development stage. While it strives to provide accurate and helpful information, there may be occasional limitations or inconsistencies in responses.
